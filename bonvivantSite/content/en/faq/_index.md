{{<faq "How is the BonVivant model special?" >}}
**BonVivant** offers a particular model where everyone does their own harvest, fills their own basket and pays according to what they have harvested. This type of personalized harvest is much better suited to the gradual maturation of plants in a forest garden. Indeed some early plants benefit from a microclimate while others delay because they receive less sun or water.

The labor costs associated with harvesting and processing are eliminated. Pickers advantageously replace their tour of the shelves of a supermarket, weighing, waiting at the checkout to refill their bags, to the parking lot, with a walk in the garden to harvest the vegetables and fruits that only they will have. affected.

{{<faq "What is the difference with AMAPs?" >}}
The [AMAPs] (http://www.reseau-amap.org/amap.php) which increasingly mesh our country bring consumers closer to producers, promote short circuits and seasonal consumption. The AMAP model replaces distribution with a direct sale of baskets, the content of which depends on the season. Most often, the customer must come at a specific time to collect his basket and must also often give a little of his time (work in the fields, packaging, sales, etc.).

To be able to supply a large number of identical baskets, AMAP relies on the traditional intensive agricultural model, based on mainly annual plants, harvested synchronously. The labor costs associated with harvesting, cleaning, storing ... products as well as the impacts on soils (plowing, leaching, amendments) or on biodiversity are in fact little different from traditional models.

{{<faq "Are there not already farms where it is the customer who harvests">}}
Some farms offer customers to come to the farm, in each of the fields, choose and harvest the products at maturity before paying for them at the farm. The products are limited to crops for which the harvest is both difficult to mechanize (small berries) and where the risk of degradation is low. We mainly see the harvest of squash, Christmas trees, raspberries and currants, and more rarely other products. <p>
These traditional farms practice monoculture. Considering an ordinary harvest of a wide variety of products would require the picker to travel great distances in often muddy fields, designed for mechanization rather than manual harvesting. Often, we come by car only once or twice, in the right season to pick something to make jams.

{{<faq "Who is a BonVivant garden intended for">}}
A third of the European population lives in peri-urban areas, which mix residential and agricultural land. In these areas less dense than the cities, consumers are often forced to take their vehicle to buy fresh produce in supermarkets in peri-urban shopping areas. A hypermarket thus has a catchment area of ​​20km in France. <p>
For a **BonVivant** garden of 3000m2 installed on agricultural land on the edge of a residential area, the client-gatherers will come from one or two hundred households within one km. The garden will allow them to come easily on foot or by bike several times a week, with fresh produce.

{{<faq "What fresh produce?" >}}
Our supply of fresh produce comes from a very small group of domesticated plants whose characteristics make them optimal for modern agriculture. Large products, most often from annual crops grown thanks to fertilizers, which can retain their desirable appearance for a long time, which withstand the vagaries of packaging and transport, and finally which remain within the framework of ordinary vegetables and fruits to which we are accustomed . The BonVivant gardens widen the range of possibilities by promoting species that have been left out a bit, resulting from perennials that require much less maintenance and water, whose products are more difficult to harvest industrially, and which do not keep their freshness only a short time. BonVivant mixes growing conditions and varieties to maximize the length of the season. Even varieties that are less productive but interesting from a taste point of view or because their maturation is earlier or later, have their place in a **BonVivant** garden.

{{<faq "Does BonVivant have the _bio_ label?" >}}
The consumption of products with the organic label is exploding in France and around the world. The problem is that the organic which originally was artisanal, has become _industriel_. The agri-food giants have understood the vein: we make industrial organic, it costs less, but we have the label. <p>
**BonVivant** does not offer organic tomatoes above ground heated with gas, organic strawberries grown under plastic oceans in Spain or Morocco, organic vegetables grown and harvested by exploited and abused workers, organic fruits processed in a _bio_ factory too. This organic label is expensive (350 € per year minimum) and complex to obtain, totally unsuitable for a small nearby garden. To keep it it is necessary to [pay an annual tax] (https://magazine.laruchequiditoui.fr/qui-tire-les-ficelles-du-bio-les-secrets-de-la-certification/) to a company private certification and fill out a changing paperwork. So no, **BonVivant** will probably never be _bio_. <p>
On the other hand **BonVivant** is
* **hyper-local** preferring members who come on foot or by bike,
* **transparent** to the point that _all_ stages of production and maintenance are done in public,
* **reasoned** for its ultra efficient water management (like a forest, in fact),
* **ecological** for its absence of waste (against [30 to 50% of world agricultural production] (https://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/actualite-economique/le-gaspillage-ferait-perdre-30-a -50-of-global-food-production_1377493.html),
* **carbon positive**, without transport, heating or mechanization and that in addition a garden fixes carbon in the soil by increasing the thickness of the organic layer,
* **biodiverse** both by the variety of its cultures but by becoming a place of life and passage for many species,
* **healthy** because outdoor exercise and contact with plants is essential for health,
* **social**, the place and the activity create a link, and the _delegated harvest_ solution allows everyone to exchange the harvest for products
* **sustainable** because perennials thrive and the garden is not a field of ruin every winter ...
