description: Perennial wheat for a healthier planet

---
80-85% of the worldâ€™s plant-based food supply comes from annual plants, that have to be grown from scratch every year. Half of calories and proteins consumed come from corn, rice and wheat. Experts worldwide think perennial grains, with long, drought-resistant roots, make more sense in a time of climate change.

The [Land Institute](https://landinstitute.org "Land Institute") has been driving the development of perennial crops in order to push regenerative agriculture. Undisturbed soils let plant roots grow very long and very deep, making the plants very much drought-resistant while capturing large amounts of carbon underground as biomass.   
[Kernza](https://landinstitute.org/our-work/perennial-crops/kernza/ "Kernza") is a distant cousin of wheat that is already used to make beer and pizza dough. This perennial crop does not have the same yield as regular wheat yet but its impact on both climate and resilience will prove essential.
