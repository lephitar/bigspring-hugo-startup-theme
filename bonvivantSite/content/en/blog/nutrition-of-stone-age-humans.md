A fascinating [study](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-04/tu-hwa040421.php "Humans were apex predators for two million years") combining elements from a variety of sources show that humans were probably apex predators and hypercarnivores for 2 million years. It was only the extinction of large animals that progressively drove humans to first consume plants (about 85000 years ago in Africa and 40000 in Europe), then domesticate plants and animals, inventing agriculture 10000 years ago in the fertile crescent.  

It is our impact on the environment (exterminating the megafauna, then largely killing medium-sized animals) that forced us to adapt our nutrition. Vegetarianism was born out of necessity!
