_Principles and objectives of Bon Vivant Garden._

# The forest garden in practice

An edible forest garden is a garden created on the model of a natural forest that incorporates species of great interest to humans. It is a stable and in principle sustainable ecosystem that mimics the structure and diversity of a natural forest. It has all the different levels of vegetation that can be found in the forest: nourishing trees, fruit trees, shrubs, herbaceous perennials, aromatics, root vegetables, edible lianas and mushrooms.

The **edible garden-forest** is an agroecological approach that draws inspiration from both agroforestry and permaculture principles by seeking to
- maximize food production while,
- minimizing work.

**Agroforestry** consists of associating trees, other crops and possibly animals on the same plot, seeking complementarities. **Permaculture** aims to imitate nature through a garden design that has the same qualities of biodiversity and resilience.

A forest garden, unlike a field or a vegetable garden, is established for many years relying as much as possible on perennials rather than annuals.

# Major advantages

The two most immediate benefits are
- the **maximum use of sunlight**,
- the **no-till**.

Every ray of sunlight that hits the earth rather than a green leaf is a missed opportunity to create biomass and fix carbon through photosynthesis.

In no-till soil, a rich fauna breaks down plant matter and produces fertile humus at increasing depth. This increases water retention, soil permeability and facilitates root penetration.

A forest-garden
- maximizes biomass production,
- exit from the vicious cycle of monoculture: plowing-amendment-planting-pesticide-plowing
- supports a very wide biodiversity, both flora and fauna,
- more resistant to pests,
- more resistant to climatic hazards.

# Two limits

The garden-forest system seems ideal on paper, the complexity and fragility of a multi-layered and extremely varied culture makes harvesting much more delicate, and therefore **expensive in labor**. In fact, in intensive agriculture, more than half of the costs and labor occur after the products have matured, even though everything is done to optimize the harvesting work (seeds and age of the plants uniform, identical conditions and spacing, mechanization, etc.) .

Our fruit trees and shrubs are perennial plants but **our diet is mainly based on a very small number of annuals**. Many plants that are difficult to exploit industrially (perish too quickly, fragility in packaging or transport, low production in the field, inability to ripen artificially, not mechanized, economic yield, etc.) have been gradually eliminated by our agriculture.

# The solution to make these limits an advantage

**Bon Vivant** proposes to set up small forest gardens for their immediate residential neighborhood. In these gardens, established and maintained by professionals, a very wide variety of edible plants produces vegetables and fruits throughout the year.

The picking of the products is entrusted to the **client-pickers**, after they have been quickly trained in how to choose and harvest their vegetables and fruits. A smartphone application precisely geolocates each plant in each garden, allowing the most novice of pickers to navigate the garden and **discover new edible plants**. The application gives for each plant present
- location (s) in the garden,
- description of the plant (images, season, origin)
- harvest advice,
- recipes and taste interest
- historical anecdotes,
- nutritional benefit,
- his price

and allows the client-gatherer to pay directly for his harvest.

**Through its approach, Bon Vivant Garden combines the extraordinary advantages of forest gardens with an economic and practical model that makes them exploitable by turning their complexity into a richness.**

# In short, the promises of organic products without the contradictions

Organic farming disappoints. It promised less impact on the planet and better quality food, but both the methods and the products are the same as conventional agriculture:
- mechanized plowing,
- artificial maturation
- storage in a cold room,
- long-distance transport by truck,
- massive losses and waste.

The only difference: limiting the use of certain synthetic fertilizers and pesticides results in lower productivity (40% less yield). This ideological choice
- increases the carbon footprint of products,
- increases their price and
- leads to the use of harmful pesticides despite their label.

Picking your own vegetables and fruits in the open air, touching the ground if necessary when you have to extract the roots, combines the benefits
- gentle exercise in the open air,
- contact with nature and
- stimulation of the immune system.

Picking your own fruits and vegetables is beneficial to health. In addition, the varied fresh products, untreated, and perfectly ripe, are at the peak of their nutritional and taste qualities.

Without plowing, objectively maximizing biodiversity, without mechanization, without recourse to the logistics system of distribution of fresh produce, produced within walking distance of the residences of client-gatherers, **the Bon Vivant gardens actively contribute to reducing our emissions and preserving the environment.**

Finally, unlike organic which compensates for its lower productivity with less accessible prices, Bon Vivant gardens offer an excellent value for money solution, a bit like IKEA, which offers its customers the opportunity to seek them out. same products in warehouse and to assemble them to be able to take advantage of very low prices.

# A breakthrough market gardening

Local market gardening is struggling to develop beyond a circle of believers, despite numerous initiatives and consumer interest even as the transport of fresh produce in Europe is exploding. **Bon Vivant Garden** offers a hyper local model of production and sale of fresh produce that combines **quality, affordability, social responsibility and ecological benefit**.

**If the Bon Vivant concept seems relevant to you, contact us. We are looking for municipalities, in peri-urban areas, which wish to provide one or more land from 3 to 5000m2, near schools and homes, to set up prototypes of Bon Vivant gardens.**
