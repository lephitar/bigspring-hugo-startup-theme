_Principles and objectives of Bon Vivant Garden._

# The forest garden in practice

An edible forest garden is a garden created on the model of a natural forest that incorporates species of great interest to humans. It is a stable and in principle sustainable ecosystem that mimics the structure and diversity of a natural forest. It has all the different levels of vegetation that can be found in the forest: nourishing trees, fruit trees, shrubs, herbaceous perennials, aromatics, root vegetables, edible vines and mushrooms.

The **edible garden-forest** is an agroecological approach that draws inspiration from both agroforestry and permaculture principles by seeking to
- maximize food production while,
- minimizing labour planting and tending.

**Agroforestry** consists of associating trees, other crops and possibly animals on the same plot, seeking complementarities. **Permaculture** aims to imitate nature through a garden design that has the same levels of biodiversity and resilience.

A forest garden, unlike a field or a vegetable garden, is established for many years and relies as much as possible on perennials rather than annuals.

# Major advantages

The two most immediate benefits are
- **maximum use of sunlight**,
- **no-till**.

Every ray of sunlight that hits the earth rather than a green leaf is a missed opportunity to create biomass and fix carbon through photosynthesis.

In no-till soil, a rich fauna breaks down plant matter and produces fertile humus at increasing depth. This increases water retention, soil permeability and facilitates root penetration.

A forest-garden
- maximizes biomass production,
- escapes from the vicious cycle of monoculture: plowing-amendment-planting-pesticide-plowing
- supports a very broad biodiversity, both flora and fauna,
- is more resistant to pests,
- is more resistant to climatic hazards.

# Two limits

A garden-forest system seems ideal on paper, but the complexity and fragility of a multi-layered and extremely varied culture makes harvesting much more delicate, and therefore **labor intensive**. In fact, in intensive agriculture, more than half of the costs and labor occur after produce have matured, even though everything is done to optimize harvesting work (uniform age of plants, identical conditions and spacing, mechanization, etc.) .

Fruit trees and shrubs are perennial plants but **our diet is mainly based on a very small number of annuals**. Many plants that are difficult to exploit industrially (perish too quickly, fragility in packaging or transport, low production in the field, inability to ripen artificially, not mechanized, economic yield, etc.) have been gradually eliminated by our agriculture.

# The solution to turn these limits into an advantage

**Bon Vivant** proposes to set up small forest gardens servicing their immediate residential neighborhood. In these gardens, established and maintained by professionals, a very wide variety of edible plants produces vegetables and fruits throughout the year.

The picking of the products is entrusted to the **client-pickers**, after they have been quickly educated in how to choose and harvest their vegetables and fruits. A smartphone application precisely geolocates each plant in each garden, allowing the most novice of pickers to navigate the garden and **discover new edible plants**. The application gives for each plant
- location (s) in the garden,
- description of the plant (images, season, origin),
- harvest advice,
- recipes and taste,
- historical anecdotes,
- nutritional benefit,
- price

and allows the client-gatherer to pay directly for her or his harvest.

**Bon Vivant Garden combines the extraordinary advantages of forest gardens with an economic and practical model that turns their complexity into a richness.**

# In short, the promises of organic products without the contradictions

Organic farming disappoints. It promised **less impact on the planet and better quality food**, but both the methods and the products are the same as conventional agriculture:
- mechanized plowing,
- artificial maturation,
- storage in a cold room,
- long-distance transport by truck,
- massive losses and waste,
- same choice of produce with no demonstrated taste or health benefits.

The only difference: limiting the use of certain fertilizers and synthetic pesticides results in lower productivity (40% less yield). Organic farming regulations
- increases the carbon footprint of products,
- increases their price and
- leads to the use of harmful pesticides.

Picking your own fruits and vegetables is beneficial to health. In addition, the varied fresh products, untreated, and perfectly ripe, are at the peak of their nutritional and taste qualities.

Without plowing, objectively maximizing biodiversity, without mechanization, without recourse to long distance transportation fresh produce, produced within walking distance of the residences of client-gatherers, **the Bon Vivant gardens actively contribute to reducing our emissions and preserving the environment.**

Finally, unlike organic which compensates for its lower productivity with higher prices, Bon Vivant gardens offer an excellent value for money solution, a bit like IKEA. At IKEA, the customers  have to pick their products in the warehouse and then assemble them in exchange for the best prices.

# A breakthrough market gardening

Local market gardening is struggling to develop beyond a circle of believers, despite numerous initiatives and consumer interest. All the while road transport of fresh produce is exploding. **Bon Vivant Garden** offers a hyper local model of production and sale of fresh produce that combines **quality, affordability, social responsibility and ecological benefit**.

**If the Bon Vivant concept seems relevant to you, contact us. We are looking for municipalities, in peri-urban areas, which wish to provide one or more land from 3000 to 5000m2, near schools and homes, to set up prototypes of Bon Vivant gardens.**
